stack new my-project
cd my-project
stack setup
stack build
stack exec my-project-exe



The stack new command will create a new directory containing all the needed files to start a project correctly.
The stack setup will download the compiler if necessary in an isolated location (default ~/.stack) that won't interfere with any system-level installations. (For information on installation paths, please use the stack path command.).
The stack build command will build the minimal project.
stack exec my-project-exe will execute the command.
If you just want to install an executable using stack, then all you have to do is stack install <package-name>.

if you want to launch a REPL:

stack ghci
